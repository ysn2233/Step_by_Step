Define a function called 'factors'
Set the input arguments to (number, name):
    Create and initialize variable 'factor' to (number subtracts 1)
    While (factor is larger than 1), do the following:
        If ((number modulo factor) is equal to 0), do the following:
            Call function 'factors' recursively with parameter of (number floor divided by factor)
            Call function 'factors' recursively with parameter of factor
            return
        The new value of factor is itself subtracts 1
    Print the result of number to screen
Call function 'factors' with parameter of 144
